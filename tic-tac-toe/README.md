# 2-Player Tic-Tac-Toe

This program demonstrates the features of lps.js's Peer-to-Peer module and features provided by LPS Studio to implement a simple 2-player Tic-Tac-Toe game.

To run this example, you need to have the [LPS CLI Tools](https://github.com/mauris/lps-cli) installed on your system using npm. 

1. Launch the P2P tracker by running `lps-p2p-tracker`. You may use the '-V' option for verbose output.
2. Launch LPS Studio. When LPS Studio is launched, only 1 window is open. Open another window by press `Ctrl+N` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+N` (macOS).
3. In each window, open the tic-tac-toe program by clicking on the folder icon on the top-right corner of the window. 

Currently the program's default settings only enable local communication. To run the programs over a network, additional configuration is needed, such as indicating the IP address of the tracker in the main program.
